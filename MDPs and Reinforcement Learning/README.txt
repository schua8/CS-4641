CS 4641 - Assignment 4

I did not write any code for this assignment. I used a Java GUI application built by graduate students at Carnegie Mellon
This application is called Reinforcement Learning - Simulator and is able at:
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/

This tool is know to work with Java Runtime Environment(JRE)1.4.2 and above. To install JRE1.4.2 and above visit http://java.sun.com.

Once java is installed and it is in path:

1.Extract RL_sim.zip to appropriate directory.
2.On windows: Start command prompt,
3.On Linux: Start shell.
4.Change directory to directory where files are extracted. Then Change directory to go in RL_sim directory.
5.Execute the command 'java -jar rl_sim.jar'

The application has an option to create GridWorlds and also comes with a few GridWorlds to use for the MDP's
